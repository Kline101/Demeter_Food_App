## SECTION B

### Introduction

Demeter, named after the Greek Goddess of Harvest, is an innovative mobile application that seeks to transform how people engage with food. In a world where health and well-being are paramount, this app provides a comprehensive solution for managing nutrition, meal planning, grocery shopping, and dietary/allergen concerns.

### Outline

Demeter will serve as a one-stop platform, offering a wide range of features, including meal and recipe recommendations, grocery/pantry assistance, dietary restriction and allergen detection, meal difficulty sorting, and seasonal dish suggestions. 
The app will be user-centric, streamlining the user experience, and promoting healthier food choices while saving time and effort. 
It will also consider the needs of individuals with eating disorders and have the potential for integration with fitness trackers and wearable devices for comprehensive health management.
The user-centric design will also ensure a streamlined experience, fostering healthier food choices while saving time and effort. 

### Background

During week 2 of the new semester where we talked about how food basically ate up a lot of our budgets' when we were on our internships during the summer. Later on that day, while Kline was talking to his girlfriend and she suggested that we should make an app that helps with what we talked about earlier. An app that would help people with their meal prepping and groceries as well. From there, the ideas just kept flowing and Demeter (Greek Goddess of Food and Harvest) was born due to our shared love of Greek Mythology. After that day, Ronghui shared the same enthusiasm about the idea and we began researching ways to make it a reality.

### Achievements
#### Investigating User Input:

- One aspect that we are focusing on is investigating various forms of user input. One main concern we have envisioned is that the user will be burdened with a large amount of user input whilst using our app. 
- We will be focusing on simplifying and reducing the user input burden to enhance user interaction not only for our app but for the broader domain of human-computer interactions
- This has the potential to affect application interaction that’s not limited to our project and is an universal approach that benefits all human-computer interactions.

#### Meal/Recipe Recommendations: 
- Implementation of recommendation algorithms, possibly involving machine learning, for personalized recipe suggestions based on user profiles and available ingredients.

#### Grocery/Pantry Assistant:
- Users can input their grocery items, and the app will assist in tracking prices and providing special discounts from partnering supermarkets (e.g., Lidl, Aldi, Supervalu).
- The user will be able to dictate what they want in their shopping list (speech to text)
- Take pictures / scan barcodes for what food they want to buy.
- Pantry feature, allowing users to use their camera or scan barcodes to add items into their “pantry”, allowing for easy recipe recommendations based on ingredients they have at their disposal.
- This feature will also serve as a way to track ingredients available to the user and is used for recipe recommendations as it also tracks the amount available.
- These features will remove a lot of tedious and repetitive procedures associated with initial data entry and would make the User Experience of Demeter a lot easier.

#### Dietary Restrictions:
- User Specific - ask users to select what diet they’re following or what food they are allergic to.
- Building on an innovative dietary restriction/allergen detection system, Demeter will help users with allergies identify potential allergens or specific dietary restrictions in food products through the use of their mobile phone cameras.

#### Meal Difficulty Sorting:
- Users will have access to a database of easy-to-cook dishes, sorted by difficulty, and recommended based on the groceries they are purchasing.
#### Seasonal Dishes:

- The app will suggest seasonal dishes to align with the time of year and ingredient availability.

#### Possible Additional Features:

- The app will include features catering to individuals with eating disorders, offering support and guidance.
- Potential commercial integrations include connecting with fitness trackers like Fitbit, wearable devices like Apple Watch, WearOS, and smartphone apps for comprehensive health management.


### Justification

In the modern world, where individuals are increasingly conscious of their health and well-being, the need for a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for managing nutrition, meal planning, grocery shopping, and dietary/allergen concerns has never been greater. "Demeter" aims to bridge the gap between these various aspects of food-related activities, providing users with a powerful tool to make informed decisions about their dietary choices. This app aims to revolutionise the way individuals interact with food, providing a comprehensive solution for nutrition management, meal planning, grocery shopping, and dietary/allergen awareness. We want to create an easy to use app that can help users with all things related to food and nutrition. This app will attempt to addresses several critical needs:

- Simplified User Experience: Demeter streamlines the user experience by reducing the burden of manual data entry, helping users make efficient choices, and ultimately saving time and effort in managing their nutrition and meal planning.

- Personalized Nutrition: The app employs machine learning to offer personalized meal and recipe recommendations, taking into account individual preferences and dietary restrictions. This feature ensures that users make healthier and more enjoyable food choices.

- Allergen Awareness: With a novel allergen detection system, Demeter empowers users with allergies or dietary restrictions to identify potential allergens in food products using their mobile phone cameras, promoting safer and more informed eating.

- Seasonal and Cost-Efficient Cooking: The app provides seasonal dish recommendations, aligning with ingredient availability and helping users save money by planning meals based on the groceries they have on hand.

As well as potential additions including:

- Support for Individuals with Eating Disorders: By catering to individuals with eating disorders, Demeter not only promotes healthy eating habits but also offers support and guidance to those in need.

- Integration for Holistic Health Management: Potential integrations with fitness trackers and wearable devices enable users to manage their overall health comprehensively, making Demeter a valuable addition to their wellness toolkit.
